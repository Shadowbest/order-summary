## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
A simple but fun challenge. Almost nothing new learned but background image size property. Now I learned that background images sizes can be controlled.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.asp) Here I learned about the basics of background-size property. Which allowed me to better position the image in the background.
